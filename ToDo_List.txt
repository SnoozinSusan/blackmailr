TODO List, prioritized:

-app/controllers/blackmail_controller.rb#show
	show the blackmail! take a look at the mock-up for 
	an idea: http://blackmailr.herokuapp.com/assets/mockups/view.png

-app/views/blackmail/edit.html.haml:
	(Julian is working on this I think) display the 'edit blackmail' form, prepopulated with the information 
	already stored in the database. The big difference between this and the 'new blackmail' form is instead 
	of one big textbox for listing demands, each demand is seperated into their own text field with a 
	"completed? checkbox

-??? (idk where this goes): 
	when blackmail expires, the information will be posted to the homepage, and the image will slowly 
	be revealed (casey magic)

-app/views/blackmail/_form.html.haml: 
	make a "add image" link to new blackmail form to add images dynamically. So instead of only being 
	able to add just one image, we can add as many images as we want. When the "add image" link is clicked, 
	another "browse" button appears, and so on.

-app/controllers/users_controller.rb#edit: 
	user's profile will show.. list of blackmail sent? or maybe list of blackmail received? 
	I'm not sure, actually..

-app/controllers/blackmail_controller.rb#create: 
	resize uploaded images with rmagic before uploading them onto the server (save space)
